# WebScraper
Simple web scraper that is currently set up for scraping Newegg.com for graphics card prices.

Uses the Beautiful Soup package for parsing the HTML and stores the data in a CSV file.

The URL that it scrapes can be changed, but that may require tweaking the HTML tags that the script grabs.
